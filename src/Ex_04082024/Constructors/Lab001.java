    Constructor:
    Same name as Class,
    No return type
    Person(){}
    Called as soon as Object is created -- new Person();
    Used to initialise the values of the parameters
    We can write new Person(); without Person p1 (without reference)

   By Default -- Default Constructor is called
   There can be only one default constructor

   There is no concept of global variable -- there is only instance variable

   - Parameterized Constructor
   Person p1=new Person("Neeru");
   Default Constructor will be called irrespective of presence of parameterized constructor
   We can also ask the values from the user and use it in PC
   We can have more than one PC

   - Copy Constructor -- not useful in Java
