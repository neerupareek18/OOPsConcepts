    /*
    Usage:
    ArrayList -- Dynamic -- Size is growable -- Load Factor (if 1.5) --(10, when reach 8 , size increase to 10*1.5)
    Load Factor is not finxed -- depends upon RAM ROM etc.
    Finding an element is easy (directly find by index)
    Deletion/Addition -- heavy (deleting/adding, shifting)
    Less memory than LinkedList
    Good for Storing and accessing the data

    LinkedList -- Finding an element is difficult (traverse all the nodes)
    Deletion/Addition -- Easy
    Doubly LL
    Good for manipulation
