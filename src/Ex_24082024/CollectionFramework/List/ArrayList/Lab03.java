    Collection Framework -- Used in API and Web Automation
    Focus on main Business logic of the program rather than Low Level Logics
    Provide inbuilt methods to perform several tasks

    Arrays --
    Since we need to provide the size, memory is wasted, no option to increase the size
    Insertion and deletion is heavy
    No built-in support for sorting, searching, appending

    ArrayList has solved these problems

    //Legacy Classes -- Old -- Stack, Vector, HashTable, Dictionary, Properties -- Enumeration is used in this for traversing
